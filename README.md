## About Me

<summary>
I grew up in Los Angeles but have called New York City home for the last decade. I am Taiwanese-American. I studied Business at the UCLA-National University of Singapore joint executive MBA program. I'm a big foodie, and you can follow my food insta @bessie_eats
</summary>

## What is your style?

<summary>

I can come across as blunt and as either enthusiastic or overly intense. I am willing to try things even if they may fail because thought exercises can lead to different way to looking at or solving the problem. I like being right, but I change my mind if arguments are compelling. Having the right information is very important to me because I have a curious nature. I enjoy conflict 
    
</summary>



## When do you like people to approach you and how?

<summary>
I like when people are prepared and come with potential solutions to workshop, even if incomplete, versus just problems. I appreciate straight direct communication - in fact, I am not great at contextual clues. Credibility matters to me. If you haven’t done the work, don’t expect me to take you seriously. I expect the same from myself

    
</summary>


## What do you value? 

<summary>
Integrity and honesty 
Thoughtfulness and curiosity
Hard work combined with smart work 
Willingness to admit failure 
Flexibility and adaptability

</summary>

## How do you like people to communicate with you?

<summary>
I prefer e-mail for async communications - will get back within a day
I tend to work in pomodoros so work actually gets done, so it may take ½ hr to get back on Slack
I am not the most responsive on text and can forget to respond. If it’s urgent, call me

</summary>

## Favorite working conditions

<summary>
Flexibility is most important to me 
I like to collaborate, but focus time is important. I try hard not to get on the “meeting treadmill” where you end up treading water with discussions but not enough time to execute 
Emergencies are fine, but I generally draw clear boundaries between the hours I’m working and not. I take my relationships and personal obligations very seriously and have the same respect for others.    
    
</summary>

## How do you make decisions?


<summary>
A mix of information and looking at future possibilities even if the data may not be available 
Weighing everyone’s opinions and larger context
I generally believe in playing the long game, but know quick wins need to be distributed on a regular cadence 

    
</details>

## How can people help you? 

<summary>
Point out what I’m not seeing. Fill me in on the details and context. If I haven’t brought it up, it is most likely I am being totally clueless. I don’t have a problem with saying I’m intentionally not doing x, y, z. 
Let me know if I or a situation is overwhelming them 
    
</summary>


## What people misunderstand about me 

<summary>
I’m willing to change my mind with facts and arguments. People mistake my enthusiasm and enjoyment of arguing for fixed ideas, but I believe one of the best things I can do is advocate for positions based on that energy and am willing to advocate for the ideas and accomplishments of others, not just my own. 
    
</summary>

    
## Blind Spots 

<summary>
My decisiveness and presence can turn people off. I can get frustrated if I perceive others are not working as hard or have the same sense of urgency as me, but I can accept that my priorities are different if I am informed of them. On the flipside of that, I sometimes have trouble expressing urgency and am generally calmer as pressure goes up, but sometimes people misinterpret that as me not caring or emotionally distant vs me trying to turn down the temperature to focus. 

</summary>

  
## What will you not tolerate in others?
    
<summary>
Unethical behavior.
Bigoted behavior, eg. sexism and treating people as less than based on immutable innate traits. 
Lack of effort with no excuses


</summary>
